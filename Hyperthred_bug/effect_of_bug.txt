I own an Intel i5 seventh generation laptop.
It is the best in its range comapared to its price.
But on the first day itself I found that this laptop is crashing very frequently.
I was transfering the files then the system freezed. I didn't care as it may happens
when transferring large no.of files. but on the following days, without any reasons
it freezed many times, while i was only using text editor.
I tried many things, edited grub, added the quite-splash edit mentioned by most of
the sites. But nothing really helps. 
 Then i checked more about this system crash, I found that there are some bugs in 
Intel Skylake and Kaby lake series.
Only thing I understood that this was something related to the hyperthreading.
I checked in the forums and found some script to diable the hyperthreading from the
starting of the system.
i tried the script and so far i didn't experience any system crash.
